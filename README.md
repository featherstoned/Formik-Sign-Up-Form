# Formik Sign-Up Form Using React 

### Description

This code is a React component that renders a sign-up form. It utilizes the useFormik hook from the Formik library to handle form validation and submission. The form consists of input fields for name, email, and password. The validate function checks for errors in the form fields, such as missing values or an invalid email format. Errors are displayed below the respective input fields in red. When the form is submitted, the onSubmit function is triggered, logging the form values to the console and displaying an alert indicating successful login. The form is structured using HTML elements and styled with CSS classes and Google Fonts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
